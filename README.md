<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Kuff was designed to fix one of the major problems with the most popular matching apps on the market. That problem being
the fact that users end up endlessly scrolling to find people that they have no compatibility with. Imagine the ability to 
simply see all the people nearby and choose a person who sparks interest. Dating shouldn't be a complicated game like 
other apps would make you believe. Kuff was built to fix that problem and bring a new approach to finding love.
